# Brand Owner Edit Capability & Slug URL Fix

## Overview
Successfully implemented edit functionality for Brand Owners to manage their own brands from the dashboard, and fixed URL inconsistencies to use brand name slugs instead of Firestore IDs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dashboard BrandDetail.jsx - Added Edit Mode for Brand Owners
**File**: `src/components/dashboard/BrandDetail.jsx`

#### New Features:
- ✅ **Edit Mode Toggle**: Brand owners can now click "Edit Brand" button
- ✅ **Comprehensive Form**: 50+ fields organized in 4 collapsible Accordion sections
- ✅ **Access Control**: Only the brand owner (userId matches) can edit their brand
- ✅ **Real-time Editing**: Changes update local state before saving
- ✅ **Save/Cancel Actions**: Persist changes to Firestore or discard
- ✅ **Auto-timestamp**: Updates `updatedAt` field on save

#### Edit Mode Sections:
1. **Basic Information** (6 fields)
   - Number of Outlets, Brand Rating, Business Model
   - Franchise Models, Industries, Revenue Model

2. **Investment & Financials** (8 fields)
   - Total Investment, Initial Franchise Fee, Security Deposit
   - Royalty Fee, Brand Fee, Investment Range
   - Expected Revenue, Expected EBITDA

3. **Business Details** (4 fields)
   - Unique Selling Proposition
   - Competitive Advantage
   - Territory Rights
   - Franchise Term

4. **Contact Information** (6 fields)
   - Owner Email, Owner Phone
   - Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn URLs

#### State Management:
```javascript
const [editMode, setEditMode] = useState(false);
const [editedBrand, setEditedBrand] = useState({});
const [isSaving, setIsSaving] = useState(false);

// Check if current user is the brand owner
const isBrandOwner = user && brand && user.uid === brand.userId;
```

#### Handler Functions:
- `handleChange(field, value)` - Simple field updates
- `handleNestedChange(parent, field, value)` - Nested object updates (e.g., brandOwnerInformation)
- `handleArrayChange(field, value)` - Array fields (comma-separated input)
- `handleSave()` - Persists changes to Firestore with updatedAt timestamp
- `handleCancel()` - Discards changes and exits edit mode

#### UI Components:
- **Edit Button**: Only visible to brand owners when NOT in edit mode
- **Save/Cancel Buttons**: Only visible to brand owners when IN edit mode
- **Material-UI Accordions**: Organize form fields in expandable sections
- **TextField Components**: All fields editable with proper labels and helper text
- **Grid Layout**: Responsive 2-column layout for form fields

### 2. AdminVerification.jsx - Fixed Slug Generation
**File**: `src/components/dashboard/AdminVerification.jsx`

#### Change:
```javascript
// BEFORE (WRONG - uses ID):
<Link component={RouterLink} to={`/dashboard/brand-details/${brand.id}`}>

// AFTER (CORRECT - uses slug):
<Link component={RouterLink} to={`/dashboard/brand-details/${brand.brandName.replace(/\s+/g, "-").toLowerCase()}`}>
```

#### Impact:
- ✅ URLs now use human-readable slugs: `/dashboard/brand-details/my-brand-name`
- ❌ No more Firestore IDs in URLs: `/dashboard/brand-details/3JcgZjvqjKXaFM15BzgY`
- ✅ Consistent with Brands.jsx navigation pattern
- ✅ Better SEO and user experience

## Architecture Summary

### Two Admin Types:

#### 1. **Site Admin** (Approves All Brands)
- Route: `/admin/brands/:id`
- Component: `AdminBrandDetail.jsx`
- Permissions: View/Edit/Delete ANY brand, Approve/Deactivate brands
- Access: Users with `admin: true` custom claim

#### 2. **Brand Owner** (Manages Own Brands)
- Route: `/dashboard/brand-details/:id` (id can be slug or Firestore ID)
- Component: `BrandDetail.jsx` (dashboard version)
- Permissions: View/Edit ONLY their own brands
- Access: Authenticated users where `user.uid === brand.userId`

## URL Handling

### Slug Detection Logic:
```javascript
// Detects if parameter is Firestore ID or slug
const isFirestoreId = id && id.length > 15 && !id.includes("-");

// Convert slug to brand name
const brandName = !isFirestoreId && id
  ? id.split("-")
      .map((word) => word.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + word.slice(1))
      .join(" ")
  : null;

// Use appropriate parameter
const { brand } = useBrand({ brandName, id: isFirestoreId ? id : null }, user);
```

### Slug Generation Pattern:
```javascript
brandName.replace(/\s+/g, "-").toLowerCase()
// Example: "My Brand Name" → "my-brand-name"
```

## User Flows

### Brand Owner Editing Their Brand:
1. Navigate to dashboard → "My Brands"
2. Click on brand name (URL: `/dashboard/brand-details/my-brand-name`)
3. Brand details page loads (read-only view)
4. Click "Edit Brand" button (only visible to owner)
5. Form sections appear with all fields editable
6. Make changes to fields
7. Click "Save Changes" → Updates Firestore with `updatedAt` timestamp
8. Success message → Returns to read-only view
9. OR click "Cancel" → Discards changes and returns to read-only view

### Site Admin Editing Any Brand:
1. Navigate to admin panel → "Brand Management"
2. Click on brand name (URL: `/admin/brands/:id`)
3. AdminBrandDetail component loads with full CRUD
4. Can edit, approve, deactivate, or delete
5. Changes saved with admin permissions

---

## Security

### Firestore Rules (Already in place):
```javascript
match /brands/{brandId} {
  // Update: Owners can update their own, admins can update any
  allow update: if isSignedIn() && 
                (request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId || isAdmin());
}
```

### Component-Level Access Control:
```javascript
// Only show edit button to brand owner
{isBrandOwner && !editMode && (
  <Button onClick={() => setEditMode(true)}>Edit Brand</Button>
)}

// Verify ownership before saving
const isBrandOwner = user && brand && user.uid === brand.userId;
```

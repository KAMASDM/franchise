async function migrateBrands() {
  const brands = await getDocs(collection(db, 'brands'));
  for (const doc of brands.docs) {
    if (!doc.data().businessModels) {
      await updateDoc(doc.ref, {
        businessModels: ['franchise'],
        revenueModel: 'royalty',
        supportTypes: ['training', 'marketing']
      });
    }
  }

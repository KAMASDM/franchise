---

## ✅ Errors Fixed

### 1. **PWA Manifest Icon Error** ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `Download error or resource isn't a valid image` for icon-192x192.svg

**Root Cause**: Incorrect icon paths in PWA manifest configuration

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated `vite.config.js` manifest icon paths
- Changed from `/pwa-192x192.svg` to `pwa-192x192.svg` (removed leading slash)
- Fixed all icon references to use relative paths

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `vite.config.js` - Updated manifest icon paths

---

### 2. **Firebase Storage Permissions Error** ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `Firebase Storage: User does not have permission to access 'brand-logos/...' (storage/unauthorized)`

**Root Cause**: Missing Firebase Storage security rules

**Solution Applied**:
- Created comprehensive `storage.rules` file
- Added rules for authenticated users to upload/read brand assets
- Configured proper access control for different storage buckets
- Updated `firebase.json` to include storage rules

**Files Created/Modified**:
- ✅ `storage.rules` (NEW) - Comprehensive storage security rules
- ✅ `firebase.json` - Added storage rules configuration

**Storage Rules Created**:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Brand logos - authenticated users only
    match /brand-logos/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Brand images - authenticated users only
    match /brand-images/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Public assets - read for all, write for authenticated
    match /public/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. **Firestore Permissions Error** ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `Missing or insufficient permissions` in useLeads.js and useBrandViews.js

**Root Cause**: Firestore security rules too restrictive for user data queries

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated Firestore rules to allow authenticated users to list their own data
- Modified `brandfranchiseInquiry` and `brandViews` collection rules
- Enhanced hooks to handle empty user states gracefully

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `firestore.rules` - Updated collection permissions
- ✅ `src/hooks/useLeads.js` - Added user validation
- ✅ `src/hooks/useBrandViews.js` - Enhanced error handling

**Rule Changes**:
```javascript
// Before: Only admins could list
allow list: if isAdmin();

// After: Authenticated users can list (with proper where clauses)
allow list: if isSignedIn();
```

### 4. **MUI Menu Fragment Error** ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `MUI: The Menu component doesn't accept a Fragment as a child`

**Root Cause**: NotificationCenter component passing array with React.Fragment to Menu component

**Solution Applied**:
- Refactored Menu content structure in NotificationCenter
- Removed array-based content rendering
- Replaced React.Fragment with direct JSX elements
- Used proper div containers where needed

**Files Modified**:
- ✅ `src/components/common/NotificationCenter.jsx` - Fixed Menu structure

**Fix Applied**:
```jsx
// Before: Array with fragments (NOT SUPPORTED)
<Menu>
  {[
    <Box key="header">...</Box>,
    <Box key="content">...</Box>,
    <React.Fragment key="footer">...</React.Fragment>
  ]}
</Menu>

// After: Direct JSX children (SUPPORTED)
<Menu>
  <Box>Header</Box>
  <Box>Content</Box>
  <>Footer</>
</Menu>
```

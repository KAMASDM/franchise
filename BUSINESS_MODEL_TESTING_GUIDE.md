## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Firestore Security Rules (Optional)

If you want to add validation for new fields:

```javascript
// In firestore.rules
match /brands/{brandId} {
  allow read: if true;
  allow write: if request.auth != null
    && request.resource.data.businessModels is list
    && request.resource.data.revenueModel is string
    && request.resource.data.supportTypes is list;
}
```

### 2. Database Rules Deployment

```bash
firebase deploy --only database
```

This will deploy the Realtime Database rules for Live Chat.

### 3. Hosting Deployment

```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

Or deploy everything:

```bash
npm run build
firebase deploy
```

## 📈 Migration Strategy

### For Existing Brands

**Option 1: Automatic Default (Recommended)**

No migration needed. Components use fallbacks:

```javascript
const displayModels = brand.businessModels || ['franchise'];
```

**Option 2: Batch Update**

Run this script in Firebase Console or Cloud Functions:

```javascript
const admin = require('firebase-admin');
const db = admin.firestore();

async function migrateBrands() {
  const brandsRef = db.collection('brands');
  const snapshot = await brandsRef.get();
  
  const batch = db.batch();
  let count = 0;
  
  snapshot.forEach(doc => {
    const brand = doc.data();
    
    if (!brand.businessModels) {
      batch.update(doc.ref, {
        businessModels: ['franchise'],
        revenueModel: 'royalty',
        supportTypes: ['training', 'marketing'],
        updatedAt: admin.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp()
      });
      count++;
    }
  });
  
  if (count > 0) {
    await batch.commit();
    console.log(`Migrated ${count} brands`);
  }
}

migrateBrands();
```

# Netlify redirects file for React Router client-side routing
# This ensures all routes are handled by the React app

# Handle all client-side routes by serving index.html
# The /* catches all paths and serves index.html with a 200 status
# This allows React Router to handle the routing on the client side
/*    /index.html   200

# Optional: Handle specific API routes if you have any backend endpoints
# /api/*  https://your-api-endpoint.com/:splat  200

# Optional: Handle admin routes with authentication (if needed in future)
# /admin/*  /index.html  200

# Handle 404s - catch any unmatched routes and let React handle them
# This is already covered by the /* rule above, but can be explicit if needed
